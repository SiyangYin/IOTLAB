  Running setup.py egg_info for package django

    

    ==========================

    Unsupported Python version

    ==========================

    

    This version of Django requires Python 3.4, but you're trying to

    install it on Python 2.7.

    

    This may be because you are using a version of pip that doesn't

    understand the python_requires classifier. Make sure you

    have pip >= 9.0 and setuptools >= 24.2, then try again:

    

        $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

        $ python -m pip install django

    

    This will install the latest version of Django which works on your

    version of Python. If you can't upgrade your pip (or Python), request

    an older version of Django:

    

        $ python -m pip install "django<2"

    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:
